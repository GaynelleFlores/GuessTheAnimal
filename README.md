# GuessTheAnimal
This is a learning project from JetBrains.
The program is a simple guessing game. It allows you to play game, see knowledge tree, search for an animal etc. 
 	While working on this project I learned:
1. What is a graph
2. How to use binary search tree
3. What is XML, JSON, YAML and how to use it with Jacson library
4. How to create a localized application using ResourceBundle Ð¸ properties files
