# The program uses the java.text.MessageFormat class to format messages.
# For correct message formatting, see the documentation for this class.
# https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/text/MessageFormat.html
#
# Please note, that the apostrophe (') is special symbol and you should double it or use alternative symbol (’)
#
# The program supports variability of messages. Use symbol '\f' (form feed) to separate them.
